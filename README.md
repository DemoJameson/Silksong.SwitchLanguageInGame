# Switch Language In Game
A Hollow Knight: Silksong mod for supporting language switching in the game.

## Features

* Support language switching in the game.
* Support language switching via shortcut key. (requires manual configuration first)

## Configuration
Recommend using the [BepInEx.ConfigurationManager](https://thunderstore.io/c/hollow-knight-silksong/p/jakobhellermann/BepInExConfigurationManager/) for easy in-game customization of settings.
If you have it installed (press F1 in-game to open the menu), navigate to the "Switch Language in Game" section to adjust options directlyâ€”no file editing required.

Alternatively, edit the configuration file located at `BepInEx\config\com.demojameson.switchlanguageingame.cfg`

## To install

### Thunderstore
It should all be handled for you auto-magically.

### Manual
First install BepInEx to your Silksong folder,
(note: this will break how thunderstore does things)

You can find it at
https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases
latest stable is currently 5.4.23.4

After unzipping, run the game once, so that the BepInEx folder structure generates
(ie: there's folders in there apart from just `core`)

Then pull this DLL, or folder including the dll in to
`Hollow Knight Silksong\BepInEx\plugins`
